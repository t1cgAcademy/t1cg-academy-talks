# t1cg-academy-talks

Our meetup format usually consists of three short talks by T1CG employees or meetup volunteers. If we don't have any voluneers to give a talk, T1CG employees will fill in. However, we encourage you to submit a talk! You can do so by [submitting a new issue here](https://github.com/t1cgAcademy/t1cg-academy-talks/issues) or messaging one of the organizers on [Slack](https://columbiawebdevmeetup.slack.com/join/shared_invite/enQtMzkzMTUwMDQ3ODE0LTBmYTM5Zjc2N2UwYzQ0OTUyMGUyMmJjOTk2OTk2NTc0OGE1Y2NhNDVkYWQ3M2NhMzEyNjBjNmVkNmQ5MGVlMzk).
